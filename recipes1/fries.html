        <!-- Description of a Fries with an image -->
        <p>
          Fries, the beloved and ubiquitous side dish, are a culinary delight
          cherished for their golden crispiness, comforting warmth, and
          satisfying simplicity. Originating from the heart of culinary culture,
          fries have become a global sensation, adored by people of all ages.
          Let's delve into the irresistible characteristics that make fries an
          enduring favorite: The Texture: The hallmark of fries is their
          textural symphonyâ€”a perfect harmony of crispy exterior and tender,
          fluffy interior. Each bite offers a delightful contrast, with the
          golden-brown exterior providing a satisfying crunch that yields to the
          soft, potato goodness within.

              <strong>Select and Wash Potatoes:</strong> Choose potatoes that are
              suitable for frying, such as russet potatoes. You can peel them if
              you prefer, or leave the skin on for a rustic look. Wash the
              potatoes thoroughly.
            </li>
  
            <li>
              <strong>Cutting:</strong> Cut the potatoes into evenly sized sticks
              or wedges. You can use a sharp knife or a French fry cutter for
              uniform shapes. Aim for about 1/4 to 1/2 inch in thickness.
            </li>
  
            <li>
              <strong>Serve:</strong> Serve the French fries immediately while
              they're still hot and crispy. You can enjoy them on their own or
              with ketchup, mayonnaise, or your favorite dipping sauce.
