          French fries are thin strips of potatoes that are deep-fried until
          they become crispy and golden brown. They are a popular and widely
          consumed snack or side dish in many parts of the world.

            <strong>Select and Wash Potatoes:</strong> Choose potatoes that are
            suitable for frying, such as russet potatoes. You can peel them if
            you prefer, or leave the skin on for a rustic look. Wash the
            potatoes thoroughly.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Cutting:</strong> Cut the potatoes into evenly sized sticks
            or wedges. You can use a sharp knife or a French fry cutter for
            uniform shapes. Aim for about 1/4 to 1/2 inch in thickness.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Serve:</strong> Serve the French fries immediately while
            they're still hot and crispy. You can enjoy them on their own or
            with ketchup, mayonnaise, or your favorite dipping sauce.
