        <h1>Fresh Italian pizza</h1>
        <!-- Description of a Pizza with an image -->
        <p>
          Fresh Italian pizza is characterized by a thin, crisp crust, minimal
          toppings with an emphasis on quality (e.g., fresh mozzarella, tomato
          sauce, basil), and a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil. Traditional
          Italian pizzas often feature simple yet flavorful combinations of
          fresh ingredients.

      <!-- Directions Section -->
      <section>
        <h2>Directions :</h2>
        <ol>
          <!-- Preheat the Oven -->
          <li>
            <strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to the highest
            temperature it can go, typically around 475-500°F (245-260°C). If
            you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while it's heating.
          </li>

          <!-- Prepare the Dough -->
          <li>
            <strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> If you're using store-bought
            dough, follow the package instructions for bringing it to room
            temperature. If you're making your own dough, roll it out on a
            lightly floured surface into your desired pizza shape and thickness.
          </li>

          <!-- Prepare the Pizza Peel or Pan -->
          <li>
            <strong>Prepare the Pizza Peel or Pan:</strong> If you have a pizza
            peel, sprinkle it with cornmeal or flour to prevent sticking. If you
            don't have a peel, you can use a flat baking sheet.
          </li>

          <!-- Assemble the Pizza -->
          <li>
            <strong>Assemble the Pizza:</strong> Place the rolled-out dough on
            the prepared peel or pan. Spread a thin layer of pizza sauce over
            the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Add slices of
            fresh mozzarella evenly over the sauce.
          </li>

          <!-- Bake the Pizza -->
          <li>
            <strong>Bake the Pizza:</strong> If you're using a pizza stone,
            carefully transfer the pizza from the peel to the stone in the
            preheated oven. If you're using a baking sheet, place it directly in
            the oven. Bake for about 10-15 minutes or until the crust is golden
            and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.
          </li>

          <!-- Finish with Fresh Basil and Olive Oil -->
          <li>
            <strong>Finish with Fresh Basil and Olive Oil:</strong> Once the
            pizza is out of the oven, sprinkle fresh basil leaves over the top.
            Drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil and season with salt and pepper
            to taste.
          </li>

          <!-- Slice and Serve -->
          <li>
            <strong>Slice and Serve:</strong> Allow the pizza to cool for a few
            minutes before slicing. Enjoy your delicious homemade Italian
            Margherita pizza!
