        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          Pizza, a culinary marvel that has transcended borders and captured the
          hearts (and taste buds) of people worldwide, is a delightful dish that
          embodies simplicity, versatility, and an explosion of flavors.
          Originating from Italy, the home of exquisite cuisine, pizza has
          evolved into a global phenomenon, with countless variations reflecting
          regional tastes and creative interpretations. Let's delve into the
          intricate details of this beloved dish: At the heart of every pizza
          lies its foundation—the crust. In Italy, the birthplace of pizza, the
          crust is a work of art. Thin, yet possessing a crisp exterior that
          shatters with each bite, it is a testament to the skilled
          craftsmanship of the pizzaiolo. The dough, a careful amalgamation of
          flour, water, salt, and yeast, undergoes meticulous fermentation,
          yielding a crust that is not merely a vessel but a canvas for flavors.

          <li>8 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
          <li>Fresh basil leaves</li>
          <li>Extra-virgin olive oil</li>

        <h2>Directions :</h2>
        <ol>
          <!-- Preheat the Oven -->
          <li>
            <strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to the highest
            temperature it can go, typically around 475-500°F (245-260°C). If
            you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while it's heating.
          </li>

          <!-- Prepare the Dough -->
          <li>
            <strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> If you're using store-bought
            dough, follow the package instructions for bringing it to room
            temperature. If you're making your own dough, roll it out on a
            lightly floured surface into your desired pizza shape and thickness.
          </li>

          <!-- Prepare the Pizza Peel or Pan -->
          <li>
            <strong>Prepare the Pizza Peel or Pan:</strong> If you have a pizza
            peel, sprinkle it with cornmeal or flour to prevent sticking. If you
            don't have a peel, you can use a flat baking sheet.
          </li>

          <!-- Assemble the Pizza -->
          <li>
            <strong>Assemble the Pizza:</strong> Place the rolled-out dough on
            the prepared peel or pan. Spread a thin layer of pizza sauce over
            the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Add slices of
            fresh mozzarella evenly over the sauce.
          </li>

          <!-- Bake the Pizza -->
          <li>
            <strong>Bake the Pizza:</strong> If you're using a pizza stone,
            carefully transfer the pizza from the peel to the stone in the
            preheated oven. If you're using a baking sheet, place it directly in
            the oven. Bake for about 10-15 minutes or until the crust is golden
            and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.
          </li>

          <!-- Finish with Fresh Basil and Olive Oil -->
          <li>
            <strong>Finish with Fresh Basil and Olive Oil:</strong> Once the
            pizza is out of the oven, sprinkle fresh basil leaves over the top.
            Drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil and season with salt and pepper
            to taste.
          </li>

          <!-- Slice and Serve -->
          <li>
            <strong>Slice and Serve:</strong> Allow the pizza to cool for a few
            minutes before slicing. Enjoy your delicious homemade Italian
            Margherita pizza!
