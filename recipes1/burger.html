        <p>
          A hamburger, often colloquially called a "burger," is a popular and
          classic fast-food dish. It typically consists of a ground meat patty,
          commonly beef, that is seasoned, cooked, and placed inside a sliced
          bun. The burger is often accompanied by various toppings and
          condiments such as lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, cheese, ketchup,
          and mustard. The combination of these ingredients creates a flavorful
          and satisfying handheld meal. Hamburgers are widely enjoyed around the
          world and have become a symbol of fast food culture. They are
          versatile, and various regional variations and gourmet renditions
          exist to cater to diverse tastes.
